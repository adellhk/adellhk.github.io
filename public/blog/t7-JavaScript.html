            <h1 align="center">Looping in Ruby vs. Looping in JavaScript</h1>
            <h3>JavaScript Loops</h3>
            <p>JavaScript has two main kinds of loops that I'm familiar with, While and For loops. A while loop simply executes a block (a chunk of code) <i>while</i> a condition is true. It looks like this:</p>
<pre>i = 0
while (i < 10) {
    console.log(i);
    i = i + 1; // This can also be written i += 1
}</pre>
            <p> A for loop is very similar to a while loop, except that the loop-specific things, such as the starting value of the counter or condition (i = 0 in the example above), the condition (i < 10), and the increment (i += 1) are all stored in the parentheses after "for" and before the block, which is contained within the curly brackets, "{}". It looks like this:</p>
<pre>for (i = 0; i < 10; i += 1) {
    console.log(i);
}</pre>
            <h3>Ruby Loops</h3>
            <p>Ruby Loops include for and while, but also some cool loops like :each and :times. These examples print the same thing as the javascript loops (namely, the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10).</p>
<pre>10.times { |i| p i}
(1..10).each { |i| p i}</pre>
            <h3>Comparing JavaScript Loops with Ruby Loops</h3>
            <p>JavaScript also has a way to iterate over a collection or enumerable, I think, called for/in, but I haven't learned that yet. Overall, I think Ruby loops are more user friendly and concise than JavaScript loops. There were several times during this week's challenges that I wished I could use Ruby loops.</p>
