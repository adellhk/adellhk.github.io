            <h1 align="center">Ruby Classes - Intro to: Classes, Instances, Instance Variables, and Instance Methods</h1>
            <h3>Classes and Instances</h3>
            <p>A class is like a design or a blueprint. Each item or <i>instance</i> of that class will have certain shared properties imparted from the blueprint or class. An instance of a class is one <i>thing</i> of that class. If you have a class "chair," it might have the properties: four legs, holds people. If you have the class "chair", you don't yet have a specific chair. When you <i>instantiate</i> the classe, or create an example of it, then you have a chair. For example, I could say that I am currently sitting on an instance of the class "chair."</p>
<pre>my_chair = Chair.new</pre>
            <h3>Instance Variables and Instance Methods</h3>
            <p>The parameters that are shared by an instance of a class are its variables and methods. If we think of our computer as a carpenter who builds chairs as we tell him to, we could tell him to create an instance of the chair and to call certain instance methods on our chair or tell us what some of the class variables of our chair are. For example:</p>
<pre>my_massage_chair = Chair.new(massage)
p my_massage_chair.current_power => 5
my massage_chair.new_power(10)
p my_massage_chair.current_power => 10</pre>
            <p>In this example, I told my carpenter to make me a new instance of chair with the parameter "massage". Assuming the chair Class accepts such a parameter, Mr. Carpenter Computer would then create a new massage chair with the name "my_massage_chair". I then called the instance method :current_power on my instance of "chair", which returned what must be the default power, 5. I then changed the power, with another imaginary method, :new_power(number), which would change the instance variable of the chair @current_power to 10. Finally, when I asked what the current_power of my_message_chair was and it returned 10. You may have noticed the @ sign in front of the instance variable. The @ sign means that the variable is an instance variable. This means that it can be accessed by other methods in my instance of the class "chair", and that it is tied to my specific chair. If I created a new chair my_new_chair = Chair.new(massage), it would have the default @current_power variable, which in this example, is 5, and if I called :current_power on my_new_chair, it would return its own @current_power, not my_massage_chair's @current_power.</p>
