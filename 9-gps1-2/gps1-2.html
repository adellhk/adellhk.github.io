        <h3>What is pair programming?</h3>
        <p>Pair programming is when two developers work together on a project at one workstation, one being a driver and one being a navigator. </p>

        <h3>Why is pair programming important to DBC?</h3>
        <p>Pair programming facilitates teamwork and allows the pairs to learn from one another. It also makes developers more efficient and reduces errors. When one developer is able to focus entirely on the direction that the pair are heading while the other developer can focus on input and creation, the two synergize and function more efficiently and productively.</p>

        <h3>Compare Driver and Navigator</h3>
        <p>The driver is the person writing the code and the navigator is double checking the code as its written and also looking ahead to see the next logical step in the program. In the most literal definition of peer-programming: the driver is the only person typing the code and the navigator is dictating what the driver types. The driver only types what the navigator says.</p>
