            <h3>The Values Which Fulfill Me</h3>
            <p>Some of the things that I've noticed give me satisfaction in my life, relating to an activity, are: challenge, community, competence, autonomy, creativity, and recognition. I try to experience and live with all of things in my everday life, although I think I'm somewhat lacking in community, since the nature of my work (small, one person photostudio) is fairly isolated from peers (I see a variety of clients, but not peers). I guess in the other things I spend a lot of time on (such as indoor rock climbing), I could do more to foster my community engagement.</p>
            <p>One of the most satisfying values to me is competence. I played the piano as a child and I still remember my satisfaction when I could play a piece unhindered by memory or technique problems and in a way that was satisfying to me, but which still honored the composer's intentions. Similarly, I still enjoy exercising competence. Earlier today I was bouldering (climbing) on a rock climbing problem at my gym (in an indoor gym, rock climbing problems are specifically designed or "set" by route setters). I was able to do it by jumping, pulling hard, and swinging around a little bit like a monkey, but I kept repeating the problem until I found a way to move through the holds with grace and poise. It was ultimately just as tiring for me to do the problem statically (under control at all times), but it more rewarding and satisfying to me. I might re-visit that problem in the future just to enjoy the movement I worked to discover in it.</p>
            <h3>Focusing on My Values to Mitigate Stereotype Threat</h3>
            <p>I think if I start to feel de-motivated or depressed for any reason at DBC, it will be helpful to me if I can think about why I want to be successful at DBC, what I'm enjoying about the proccess, and which of the things that I value (challenge, community, competence, autonomy, creativity, and recognition) I can focus on to improve my enjoyment of the proccess at DBC.</p>
            <h3>The Last Time I was Asked for Advice</h3>
            <p>Was this morning! I had a client asking my opinion and direction for several choices relating to her appearance in our shoot (which shoulder to wear her hair over, etc). In general, if I feel competent and confident in a subject, I am happy to give advice. Somitems I have to work on not over-sharing, but other times I think I will be able to connect with more people if I can communicate that I would like to help them (in whatever area), without being overbearing.</p>
