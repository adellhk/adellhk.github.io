            <h1 align="center">One Issue in Tech: Net Neutrality</h1>
            <h3>What is Net Neutrality?</h3>
            <p>Net Neutrality is the idea that no one or thing should effect or have access to the information that an internet user such as you or me sends to and from the internet. In practical applications, ISPs such as Comcast and Time Warner Cable, have sought in the past to block or limit bandwidth-intensive uses of the internet such as peer to peer filesharing and gaming. It makes sense that an ISP would seek to limit or prohibit an activity that consumes a majority of bandwidth by a minority of users, however doing so also opens the door for other selective targetting, such as an ISP controlling what sites a user can visit or giving preference to websites or services that pay them so that users are more likely to visit them.</p>
            <h3>What is Happening with Net Neutrality?</h3>
            <p>Since May 15, 2014<sup><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/16/opinion/searching-for-fairness-on-the-internet.html?_r=0">1</a></sup> the Federal Communications Commission (<a href="fcc.gov">fcc.gov</a>) has been considering two options: either allow ISPs to divide the internet into fast and slow lanes, the antithesis of net neutrality; or reclassify broadband as a telecommunications service, which would make it subject to stricter regulations, which would prevent ISPs from being able to tamper with users' data and preserve net neutrality. On November 10, 2014, President Obama <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKcjQPVwfDk">recommended</a> that the FCC support net neutrality, however the FCC operates as a separate agency from the White House, so his recommendation is simply that.</p>
            <h3>What We Can Do</h3>
            <p>A concerned individual could <a href="http://www.savetheinternet.com/what-can-i-do">take steps</a>, such as calling or emailing the FCC, congress, or a news agency, however I personally feel that I am an impotent face among the masses and all I can do is wait and see. I feel guilty saying that, but it's true. I'm impotent and busy, and, I guess, apathetic. :-/</p>
