            <h3>What is Stereotype Threat?</h3>
            <p>Stereotype threat is the risk of an individual conforming to a negative stereotype that describes them. For example, black college students are likely to perform worse than they otherwise would have on standardized tests when their race is emphasized. <a href="http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/definition.html"><sup>reference</sup></a>  
            </p>
            <h3>When I've felt Stereotype Threat</h3>
            <p>When I was in grade school, I moved around through a number of schools until eventually returning to the one I would have originally been sent if I had stayed in the same school system in the same city and state. Because I had spent a few years growing up with these kids, I had foreknowledge of some of them, but foreknowldge removed by about 8 years. In other words, I was an outsider, but not completely. I felt, however, in my head, that I was an outsider and I think I formed my behavior to fit my perception. I didn't try to make friends, or integrate myself when in retrospect, I think I should have. While this is not an exact example of stereotype threat, I think it is very similar, in that I felt that something was true about myself--I was an outsider--and I conformed to my own expectations for that stereotype--that outsiders don't integrate themselves fluidly.</p>
            <h3>Transcending Stereotype Threat</h3>
            <p>At DBC the only stereotype threat I anticipate encountering myself is "lazy & too-cool-for-school", but I actually think I will be too involved, stimulated, and interested by the program to willfully disengage myself as I have in the past. If I do find myself going to that place, I think the best thing to get out of it, will be to focus on what it is I like about DBC, what I want to get done at DBC, and how to accomplish my goals pertaining to DBC. Likewise, if witnessed a black (african american) boot (DBC student) at DBC at risk for Stereotype Threat, I would skip racial fortification (such as "black people are really just as smart as anyone else!") and jump straight to the indivdual and their goals (such as what they want from DBC, why they can succeed at DBC, and why they want to succeed at DBC).</p>
