The Basics of Git, Github, and Version Control
11.2.2014

Version control allows developers to track the changes they make to a software repository (collection). This is useful because it allows them to revert changes if something breaks and it allows them to collaborate with other people on the same project (repository) simultaneuosly.

Git is a form of version control. Each time a developer does some work in a git-tracked projet, they can then "add" those changes to a "commit" and then "push" them to the repository where everyone else will be able to see them too.

Github is a website that helps developers use git. It allows people to more easily collaborate and share their work. It's also free!
