            <h3>My Dad Drives Quickly</h3>
            <p>I am driving from Atlanta to San Francisco for DBC. My father, who lives in San Jose but flew to Atlata to make the drive with me, and I are taking turns driving and resting. We have been driving for thirty hours and have another seven to go (which is why I'm doing my DBC week-8 work from the passenger seat). I'll add pictures to this post on Jan. 6th. Anyway, my father, who is a cross-country roadtrip veteran, prioritizes maintaining his cruising speed and is peeved whenever he has to slow down suddenly. This usually occurs when an eighteen wheeler on this two lane road changes lanes as my we are approaching on his left to pass him. Sometimes it's because the eighteen wheeler is trying to give space to a stopped vehicle (both for their safety and so that his draft doesn't rustle the people in the stopped vehicle as much), other times it is to pass a slower vehicle. In any case, I like to practice following-distance zen, which is basically slowing down early before getting close to the slower vehicle in front of you. My father doesn't like to brake though, which often makes me feel uncomfortable and unsafe. At first, when it was upsetting to me, I talked to him about the minimal benefit and increased risk from following closely, but later, I told him that it made me uncomfortable. The second approach was definitely more effective and I feel better talking about my own feelings, which I'm intimately aware of, than when I talk about facts and data, which I think I'm right about, but which are contestable.</p>
            <p>Reflecting on this, I think that when I have a concern caused by other peoples' actions, I should try to speak about how their actions affect me, which is something mentioned in the readme for this challenge as well as a topic we learned about when we were being introduced to <a href="c5-feedback.html">A.S.K. feedback</a>.</p>
