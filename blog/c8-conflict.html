            <h3>My Dad Drives Quickly</h3>
            <p>I am driving from Atlanta to San Francisco for DBC. My father, who lives in San Jose but flew to Atlata to make the drive with me, is driving my car with me and we are taking turns driving and resting. We have been driving for thirty hours and have another seven to go (which is why I'm doing my DBC week-8 work from the passenger seat). I'll add pictures to this post on Jan. 6th. Anyway, my father, who is a cross-country roadtrip veteran, prioritizes maintaining his cruising speed and is peeved whenever he has to slow down suddenly, which is usually only when an eighteen wheeler on this that two lane road changes lanes. Sometimes the other vehicles are pulling over to give space for a stopped vehicle (both for safety and so that their draft doesn't rustle the people in the stopped vehicle as much), other times it is often to pass a slower vehicle. In any case, I like to practice following-distance zen, which is basically slowing down early, before getting close to the slower vehicle in front of you. My father doesn't though, which often makes me feel uncomfortable and unsafe. At first, when it was upsetting to me, I talked to him about the minimal benefit and increased risk from following closely, but later, I told him that it made me uncomfortable. The second approach was definitely more effective and I feel better talking about my own feelings, which I'm intimately aware of, than when I talk about facts and data, which I think I'm right about, but are contestable.</p>
            <p>Reflecting on this, I think I should try to speak more about how other peoples' actions affect me, which is something mentioned in the readme for this challenge as well as a topic we learned about when we were being introduced to <a href="c5-feedback.html">A.S.K. feedback</a>.</p>
