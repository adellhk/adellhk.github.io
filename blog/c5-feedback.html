            <h1 align="center">On Pair Programming, My Ego, and <i>A</i>ctionable <i>S</i>pecific and <i>K</i>ind Feedback</h1>
            <h3>Pair Programming</h3>
            <p>Pair programming is when two people work together on the same problem as a team. Typically, one person drives, or types, while the other person navigates, or tells the driver what to type. You could imagine how this could be benificial with a pair who compliment each other well, but cumbersome if the pair does not synergize well. In a recent pair programming session, I felt that I needed to "perform" or "show-off" in front of my pair (we usually share screens and voice or video chat while pairing). I think this was detrimental as I was less thorough in my analysis of the code in an effort to present an accomplished and knowledgeable front. In contrast, in the majority of my pair programming session I have had a partner who put me at ease immediately with his or her humility and friendliness and I felt calm and took a careful and thorough, but efficient approach, which served us well. I think in these two differing experiences, the end result was similar; we finished the challenges thoroughly and in similar amounts of time, but, clearly to me, there is a lesson to be learned here.</p>
            <h3>My Ego</h3>
            <p>At DBC we can control to some extent who we pair with, but a much better approach, rather than trying to only pair with people who I know put me at ease, would be to become one of those people who calms other programmers with his humble and open demeanor. I think I can accomplish this by being vulnerable and open about what I don't know. When I do have a solution, I can be patient and engage my pair, giving him or her an opportunity to be heard in their solution while possibly pointing out a helpful method that will do nicely, such as, "Have you considered the :map method?". It is difficult for me when I can see a solution not to just blurt it out.</p>
            <h3>A.S.K. Feedback</h3>
            <p>Actionable, Specific, and Kind feedback is essentially feedback that gives someone a specific step they can take that we think could better them. Each letter is a criteria of the feedback: Actionable: something that can be changed or that the receiver can take an action toward; Specific: what specifically can be changed or improved; Kind: feedback left with the intent of betterment, not hatred. At DBC, we leave A.S.K. feedback for everyone that we pair with through a web app called "feedbackinator." A good example of brief, but A.S.K.-fulfilling feedback might be:<br>
                "I enjoyed pairing with you recently! You have a strong grasp of Ruby fundamentals and the CLI, and a kind and humble demeanor. I was put at ease by your openness and strong communication skills, which helped me function better throughout the session. It seems like you shy away from using hashes, but are very comfortable with arrays. I suspect that in the future we will have to use hashes with some frequency and perhaps you could familiarize yourself with them by implementing them when applicable in your code this week. Since you are already very comfortable with arrays, I bet you will master hashes easily. Overall, I think you are a great pair and very much on-track with our cohort. I look forward to pairing with you again or seeing you on-site!"
            </p>
            <p>I really enjoy receiving feedback, especially critical, actionable feedback. Sometimes it's hard for me to leave feedback because I have something specific that I want to say, but I'm not sure how to say it in a kind way. I would lean toward just stating simply what I think, with the intention of helping the other person, but I have a critical eye (or mind) and stating clearly and simply what I think might come across as unkind. We give meta-feedback, that is, we rate (anonymously) each others' anonymous feedback and only if it is voted to be A.S.K. enough, does it get delivered to the intended recipient. I'm somewhat afraid that my feedback will be deemed unkind and then my recipient won't see it, which would mean that I wasted time leaving it (except I guess I would have gained knowledge of what is too blunt). In any event, I usually err on the side of being less blunt and less specific in the actionable portion of my feedback (say I thought of 5 things that someone might improve, I probably won't list all 5). I'm not sure if this is the most benificial approach to the recipient, as if I am too blunt, they might feel attacked halfway through reading the feedback and close their mind to what I'm saying, which would probably mean that they benefit from none of the feedback, whereas if I omit some things, then they will never get to know what I thought (not that I'm an arbiter of DBC boots..). I think, overall, the feedback in the feedbackinator tends to be vague and not critical or actionable enough, but then I would also be most happy if, in their feedback, people just wrote (to me), "I thought you were insecure at the outset of our pairing session, which cramped your ability to function normally. This lessened as the session progressed and I got to see a much better side of you as you built up confidence. You seem to have an acceptable grasp of Ruby, but would benefit from learning more about regex and classes. There are some valuable sections in the pickaxe book and on the corresponding ruby-doc.org pages (http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Class.html). Let's keep studying and we'll both do well at DBC!"</p>
