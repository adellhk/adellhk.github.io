            <h1 align="center">My Thinking and Learning Style</h1>
            <p>As part of my Dev Bootcamp pre-phase-0 prep, I took a <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">Gregorc learning style inventory</a>. Anthony Gregorc, the man who pionereed the Gregorc Mind Styles, categorizes our minds' styles on their perceptual quality and ordering ability. He categorizes perception as either concrete: we perceive what we can with our senses and take it at face value; or abstract: we visualize and conceive with our imagination and intuition. He categorizes ordering ability as sequential: when we organize information linearly, or random: when we organize things mentally in chunks, unrelated to their position in a linear progression of steps, and tend to skip around. Neither of the two perceptual qualities or ordering abilities is exclusive. Most, if not all people will have some tendencies toward all four combinations styles, but a leaning or inclination toward one.</p>
            <p>In my learning style inventory I scored highest for Abstract Sequential (10), followed by Abstract Random (7) and Concrete Random (7), and lowest in Concrete Sequential (6). On a <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">website</a> about Gregorc learning styles, I've considered the traits that resonate most with my struggles at DBC. These are:</p><pre>
ยง Being forced to work with those of differing views
ยง Repeating the same tasks over and over
ยง Not monopolizing a conversation
</pre>
            <p>Sometimes when I'm <a href="../9-gps1-2/gps1-2.html">pair programming</a> with others, I have to check myself before I dominate our conversation and path with my thoughts or opinions. It's also important, though, to have a good balance and still maintain open channels in our pair and communicate our thoughts. I also really dislike doing things repeatedly, such as answering similar reflection for each challenge. I think I just have to get over this. Lastly, this comes up infrequently, but I struggle when I have to collaborate with someone who has an entirely different approach to something when I deem it to be inferior. When I'm unfamiliar with something, which is often at DBC, I will hold my tongue if I suspect but am not certain that an approach will lead us awry. If we progress through the approach and it turns out to be fine, I feel elated, and glad that I went with the flow and learned something new. If we progress through the approach and my initial apprehension is affirmed, then I feel helpless and frustrated, as I don't want to force my opinion in future instances of uncertain-unease, but I don't like ending up in a situation that might have been avoided. ...Upon reflection after writing that last, it is clear to me that the best solution is to gauge my pairing partner to see how directly I should communicate without being forceful and then voice my apprehension so that we may reach a mutual conclusion as to the best approach (I feel akin to an Aspie writing this).</p>
            <p>We've also, as part of our pre-phase-0 prep work and as part of week 1, covered fixed vs growth mindset, or neuro plasticity. These are the idea that our brains are malleable and what we may consider to be "core traits" such as the Gregorc Learning Styles will be influenced and either changed or reinforced based on our mental and bodily behaviors. I think that by reflecting on my challenges and struggles at DBC (as well as in my general life), such as in the previous paragraph, I will be able to grow into a continually more satisfying (to me) person.</p>
